			<h2>Home Page for A Day in the Life: Dinosaurs</h2>
			<p>Welcome to A Day in the Life: Dinosaurs! The dinosaurs lived a much simpler life, one of searching for 
			food and procreation to maintain the species. This simulation aims to recreate the lifestyle of a herbivore 
			and carnivore species.</p>

			<p>The virtual world contains obstacles and plants for the dinosaurs to interact with during their exploration. 
			The obstacles are rocks, boulders, and logs that can be hidden behind by, or block the line of sight of, the 
			dinosaurs. The plants will grow until a certain point where they will scatter seeds to have more plants grow.</p> 

			<p>The herbivore species searches for plants to eat to gain energy and creates offspring once they reach a 
			certain energy level! The herbivore will also attempt to hide from spotted carnivores behind obstacles around 
			the virtual world.</p>

			<p>The carnivores have genetics that define how they will interact with the virtual world. Each carnivore has 
			some combination of an aggression, strength, and speed trait. These traits combine to create a variety of different 
			carnivores in the virtual world.</p>

			<p>The virtual world will appear different based on the number of dinosaurs, obstacles, and plants that are present 
			in the simulation. Please see the instructions to find out how you can change the outcome of the virtual world!</p>

			<p>Message from the creators: </p>
			<blockquote id="Author">
			We are so thankful that you have decided to experience our dinosaur simulation! We hope that you enjoy 
			our creation and save the dinosaurs! If you find any bugs, glitches, or missing components feel free to 
			post them on the forum for the simulation and the creators will address the problems. Good luck! – Project Team J

			<h2>Instructions to Use the A Day in the Life: Dinosaurs Simulation</h2>
			<p>The Day in the Life: Dinosaurs simulation allows the user to watch life unfold on their screen! The user chooses 
			the initial settings of the virtual world and watches how their decisions affect the way the life forms interact with 
			their environment.</p>
			<p>Let's get started!</p>
				<p>Step 1: Download the game and make sure the following files are present.</p>
				<ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
					<li>src</li>
					<li>images</li>
					<li>Resources</li>
					<li>CS499LifeSimulator.iml</li>
					<li>LifeSimulation01.xml</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Step 2: Choose from the following options.</p>
				<ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
					<li>You can start the simulation by pressing the play icon.</li>
					<li>You can edit the .xml file to adjust the initial settings of the simulation (see Step 3).</li>
					<li>You can view this webpage to get more information by clicking the blue link on the left side of the screen (see Step 4).</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Step 3: You selected option B from Step 2, to edit the .xml file. Choose from the following options.</p>
				<ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
					<li>You can edit the .xml by changing the values of the existing fields in the 01 version of the .xml file.</li>
					<li>If you need help understanding the .xml file and adding new instances of life forms, please see the XML Help tab above!</li>
					<li>If you understand how to edit the .xml file, you can edit, add, or delete portions of the file.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Step 4: You selected option from Step 2, visit the webpage. Choose from the following options.</p>
				<ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
					<li>You can navigate through the webpage content using the tabs located across the top of the pages.</li>
					<li>You can return to the game by returning to the window containing the game. The webpage can be left open without interfering 
					with the simulation and for your reference while the simulation is running.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Step 5: Aim to create a stable world!</p>
				<ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
					<li>A stable world occurs when the amount of one life form does not exceed the number of another life form. All of the life forms 
					exist in a constant circle of life where no life form completely disappears from the simulation. </li>
				</ul>

			<h2>Controls: Navigating the Simulation</h2>
				<h4>Simulation Screen</h4>
					<p>The simulation screen is in the center of the window and contains the map plus all of the life life forms. This is where you will observe 
					the behaviors of the life forms and the obstacles. Use this screen to observe the behaviors, adjust the XML file, and understand the report.</p>
				<h4>Start Button</h4>
					<p>Use the play button icon to start the simulation.</p>
				<h4>Speed Slider</h4> 
				<p>Use the slider at the bottom of the screen to adjust the speed of the simulation.</p>
					<h6>Use the Reset button to reset the speed to 1!</h6>
				<h4>Save Button</h4>
					<p>Use the save button to save the state of the simulation that can be reloaded at a later point.</p>
				<h4>Zoom Slider</h4>
					<p>Use the slider on the right side of the screen to zoom in and out of the simulation to get different views.</p>
				<h4>Scroll Bars</h4>
					<p>Use the scroll bars on the simulation map to scroll around the simulation to view all the different life forms.</p>
				<h4>Open Another XML File Button</h4>
					<p>Use this button to open another version of the .xml file to use for the simulation.</p>
				<h4>Report Button</h4>
					<p>Use the report button to generate the current statistics of the simulation based on the .xml file that you used.</p>
				<h4>Displays</h4>
					<p>Use the displays to view the current dimensions and number of life forms present in the simulation.</p>
				<h4>Instructions Link</h4>
					<p>Use the blue link on the left of the screen to navigate to this webpage.</p>

			<h2>A Day in the Life: Dinosaurs -- FAQs</h2>
				<h5>1) How do I start the simulation?<br></h5>
					<p>Use the play button to start the simulation. The play button becomes the pause button that you can use to pause the simulation 
					at any point!<br></p>
				<h5>2) How do I edit the XML file?<br></h5>
					<p>For general instructions and help for editing the XML file, see the XML Help tab above. Start by opening the XML file that comes with the 
					simulation. If you make any changes to the original file, save the file with the changes under a new name. A good name for the file is one 
					that will let you know what changes you made.</p>
					<p>For example: If you make an XML file with just Grazer life forms, and no other life forms, a good name would be GrazersOnly.xml.<br></p>
				<h5>3) How do I open a previous XML file that I made?<br></h5>
					<p>Use the button labeled "Open Another XML File" to access the XML files you have created. NOTE: Make sure that all XML files are saved to the 
					same location as the original XML file!<br></p>
