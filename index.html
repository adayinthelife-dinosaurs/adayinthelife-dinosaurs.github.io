			<h2>Welcome to the Home page!</h2>
			<p>Welcome to A Day in the Life: Dinosaurs! The dinosaurs lived a much simpler life, one of searching for 
			food and procreation to maintain the species. This simulation aims to recreate the lifestyle of a herbivore 
			and carnivore species.</p>

			<p>The virtual world contains obstacles and plants for the dinosaurs to interact with during their exploration. 
			The obstacles are rocks, boulders, and logs that can be hidden behind by, or block the line of sight of, the 
			dinosaurs. The plants will grow until a certain point where they will scatter seeds to have more plants grow.</p> 

			<p>The herbivore species searches for plants to eat to gain energy and creates offspring once they reach a 
			certain energy level! The herbivore will also attempt to hide from spotted carnivores behind obstacles around 
			the virtual world.</p>

			<p>The carnivores have genetics that define how they will interact with the virtual world. Each carnivore has 
			some combination of an aggression, strength, and speed trait. These traits combine to create a variety of different 
			carnivores in the virtual world.</p>

			<p>The virtual world will appear different based on the number of dinosaurs, obstacles, and plants that are present 
			in the simulation. Please see the instructions to find out how you can change the outcome of the virtual world!</p>

			We are so thankful that you have decided to experience our dinosaur simulation! We hope that you enjoy 
			our creation and save the dinosaurs! If you find any bugs, glitches, or missing components feel free to 
			post them on the forum for the simulation and the creators will address the problems. Good luck! – Project Team J
